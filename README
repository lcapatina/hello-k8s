# Vue - flask application using K8s

Prerequisite:
- Have docker and kubectl installed
- Have a running local cluster: `minikube start --drivevr=none`


Notes:
- To deploy on k8s according to the manifest file in yml: `kubectl apply -f <manifest_file>`. This can be done for creating deployments, services, configuration maps.
- Important observation: in a deployment, if we point towards an image with the latest tag, k8s doesn't seem to detect if the image has changed. To be investigated later. The current solution is to increment the version.
- To bring down the pods in a deployment, this can be achieved through a scaling to 0 replicas: `kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=0`
- In order to redirect the necessary flow to the backend, try using ingress with 2 rules, forwarding `/` to the vue app and `/api` to the flask application.
- When on WSL, in order to visualize the webpage in the browser, the DNS entry `<minikubeIP> <ingressDomain>` needs to be added on the Windows side
